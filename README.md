https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/EBAbZbW2k For this assignment, I created three separate classes for a car, truck, and frog. I created a road for the background, and made the cars move back and forth on the road, bouncing off of the canvas. I did this by adding a variable to the this.x, and then making that variable equal its negative once it hit the boundaries. For the frog, I was supposed to make it start in the middle and move, and even though I have the keypressed down, the Class made it unable to run, and I was unable to figure it out in time.
